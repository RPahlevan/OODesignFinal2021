Ericsson Object Oriented Design Pattern course

This repo was created and maintained to achieve specific market requirements (MRs) laid out by the instructor of an Object-Oriented Design course run internally for Ericsson employees. It should be noted that this code is not reflective of any past, current, or future Ericsson product. Rather, it serves as a toy exercise to demonstrate how design patterns could be applied to overengineer a solution to a possible problem within the telecommunications space.
